# A_Network_analysis_of_Game_of_Thrones_In_Python

Project Description 
==================== 
Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!

In this project, you will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). You will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available here. For more information on this dataset have a look at the Network of Thrones blog.

This project assumes you are familiar with the networkx package in python and different network centrality measures. It also assumes that you have used pandas and can manipulate python DataFrames. Before starting this project we recommend that you have completed these knowledges:

i) Network Analysis in Python (Part 1)
ii) Python pandas Foundations


How to Open notebook.ipynb Project File 
=======================================  

i) Free download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ based upon your computer's operating system.

ii) After downloading Anaconda, Launch "Jupyter Notebook" from Start Menu -> Anaconda.

iii) Move to the directory on "Jupyter Notebook" where you have stored the .ipynb file.

iv) Double click to open the File on "Jupyter Notebook" software.

v) The Jupyter notebook shall reside under the folder "A_Network_analysis_of_Game_of_Thrones_In_Python". 
   You can download the A_Network_analysis_of_Game_of_Thrones_In_Python.zip file and unzip at your favorite location to see the notebook.

vi) The datasets which are used on this project shall reside under the folder A_Network_analysis_of_Game_of_Thrones_In_Python\_\datasets

vii) All the required images shall reside under folder A_Network_analysis_of_Game_of_Thrones_In_Python\_\img
